Our expertise combines scientific rigour with practical applications. We develop robust UAV flight plans, calibrate sensors, process and analyse imagery, and validate results against ground truth. We apply advanced statistical modelling, machine learning and domain knowledge to extract meaningful phenotypic traits and support breeding decisions.
